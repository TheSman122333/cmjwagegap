			<h2>All About the Wage Gaps:</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
					The wage gap is an incredibly pressing issue in today’s society. Wage gap is defined as the difference in earnings between two or more groups of people. Today, we will be exploring the wage gap based on race and also the wage gap based on gender.
				</p>
				<p>
					The wage gap mainly occurs when people do the same amount of work and have the same amount of qualifications, yet get paid differently solely based on their identity. We can see this in the gender and race wage gaps. It is proven through many studies that women are often paid less than men even when they have the same skills and work experience (Kochhar, 2023). In addition to gender, race also plays a huge factor in the wage gap. Asian people are shown to make the highest income on average, whereas Hispanic people make the least. This is due to stereotypes between races and prejudice against someone. Click the 'next' button to read more about the wage gap.

					The gender wage gap emerged as a large political issue in the 1860s. Since then, there have been several efforts to bridge this gap by several activists, including but not limited to Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Stanton.

			As we can see from this information, the wage gap is a critical issue in the U.S. Today, we will be looking at how we can use math, science, and social studies concepts to bring justice for those affected by this issue. Differences in salary are even more alarming when we look at the gaps between different races and ethnicities.

			<h2>The story starts...</h2>
			<p>Today, we have two neighbors, Ana and Jin, who are applying for the same job. Let's see what happens and learn about how the wage gap affects different races and genders along the way</p>
			<h3> Scene 1 </h3>
			<img src="/images/scene1dinner.png" alt={`Dinner (scene 1)`} class="float-img" />

			<p style="margin-left:50px" class=> Ana and Jin have both finished their applications for a job at Vitality Physical Therapy. They are celebrating their completion of the application by having dinner together.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left:50px" class=>
			Ana: "I'm so excited to apply for this job! I've heard great things about the company.
			<br>
			"Jin: "Me too, Ana! I hope we both get in."
			</p>
			<h3 style="margin-top:200px"> Scene 2 </h3>
			<img src="/images/scene2salaries.png" alt={`Salaries (scene 2)`} class="float-img" />
			<p style="margin-left:50px">
			Later that week, both Jin and Ana received letters from the company which declared that they both got the job. They were both very excited to work at the company. However, their letters differed slightly when it came to their salaries.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-left:50px">
			Ana (reading): "Congratulations! We are pleased to offer you a position with an annual salary of $45,000."
			<br>
			<br>
			Jin (reading): "Congratulations! We are pleased to offer you a position with an annual salary of $50,000.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-left:50px">
			Even though Ana and Jin have the same qualifications and are hired for the same job, there's a difference in their salaries. This is an example of the wage gap that can occur based on race and ethnicity.
			</p>
			<img src="/images/mediansalarytable.png" alt={`table1 (test 1)`} class="float-img" width=750px style="margin-top:50px"/>
			<p style="margin-top:65px">
			Because Ana is a female, she isn't considered as much as Jin is. Ana is lucky that she got the job as most companies hire males over females. The main reason for this is because hiring males impose a lesser cost than hiring females (ex. maternity leave). 
			</p>
			<p>
			Some companies also stereotype women and assume that they have less experience than men and can't work well. As you can see on the graph above, women have a huge difference in their pay when you compare it to men.

		Year 1: Ana $45,000, Jin $50,000
		<br>
		Year 2: Ana $47,000, Jin $53,000
		<br>
		Year 3: Ana $49,000, Jin $56,000
		<br>
		Year 4: Ana $51,000, Jin $59,000
		<br>
		Year 5: Ana $53,000, Jin $62,000
		<br>
		</p>
		<p>
		Common Difference of Ana’s Salaries: 47000-45000 = 49000 - 47000 = 2000
		</p>
		<p>
		Since there is a common difference in the salaries from year to year, In order to find the sum of their salaries in 5 years, we can use the Sum of Arithmetic Sequence Formula:
		</p>
		<p>
		Sn= n(a1 + an2) where n would be the number term(which in this case is the number of years we’re looking at), a-1 would be the starting term(salary), and a-n would be the final salary we are looking at(so if we’re looking for the sum of the salaries of 5 years, then a-n would be Year 5’s salary.  Let’s look at the sum of Jin’s salary over 5 years as an example. 
		</p>	
		<p>
		n = 5 years, a1 = 50,000, an=62,000
		</p>
		<p>
		So, S5 = 5 (50000 + 620002) = $280,000

			<img src="/images/research.png" alt={`Jin calls Ana`} class="float-img" />

			<p>Ana and Jin also noticed a few other differences between their work as well as the new promotion that Jin received. Ana was often tasked with the grunt work-leftover clients that no one wanted to take on. However, Jin would always get the fun work and would be able to do what he wanted to. In addition to this, Ana was often met with low expectations and people didn't believe in her full potential, whereas Jin would have high expectations and would struggle with meeting them.</p>

			<h2>Data</h2>
			<p>Ana and Jin both decide to dive deeper into the promotion situation and how race and gender might affect one’s ability to receive a promotion. Upon researching, they find from the Harvard Business Review that:
				“Paradoxically, just when women are most likely to need sponsorship—as they shoot for the highest-level jobs—they may be least likely to get it. Women are still perceived as “risky” appointments for such roles by often male-dominated committees. In a study of top-performing CEOs, for instance, the women were nearly twice as likely as the men to have been hired from outside the company. That finding suggests that women are less likely to emerge as winners in their firms’ own CEO tournaments.”
				“Men and women alike say they get valuable career advice from their mentors, but it’s mostly men who describe being sponsored”
				“In 2008, 78% of men were actively mentored by a CEO or another senior executive, compared with 69% of women. More women than men had junior-level mentors: 7% of women were mentored by a nonmanager or a first-level manager, compared with 4% of men.”
			</p>
			<p>Race also has a large impact on disparities in wage.</p>
			<img src="/images/data.png" alt={`Statpage 8`} class="float-img" />

			<p>
				(Earnings Disparities by Race and Ethnicity, n.d.)
				In Michigan, where Jin and Ana live, the average for an Asian worker’s weekly earnings is $1,161, while that for a Hispanic/Latino person is at $744.78.

			<h2>Comparing numbers...</h2>
			<img src="/images/research2.png" alt={`Statpage 8`} class="float-img" />
			<p>
				Ana: "So basically, what this research is saying is that women trying to get top jobs often don't get support from inside their company because they're seen as risky choices, which makes it harder for them to move up."
				<br>
				<br>
				Jin: "And more successful female CEOs are more likely than male CEOs to be hired from outside their company, showing that women have fewer chances to get promoted from within."
				<br>
				<br>
				Ana: “And gender is not the only factor that affects salary. In Michigan, where we live, the average for an Asian worker’s weekly earnings is $1,161, while that for a Hispanic/Latino person is at $744.78.”
				<br>
				<br>
				Jin: “That means that the Asian worker earns $416.22 more than the Hispanic worker each week. This means that the Asian worker earns almost 22 thousand more than the Hispanic worker does each year.”
				<br>
				<br>
				Ana: "Wow, this is really unfair: Men get more help advancing their careers (aka sponsorship) from mentors than women do, even though both men and women get advice about their careers from mentors. Also, Asian workers earn so much more than Hispanic workers do, just because of their race."
				<br>
				<br>

				As demonstrated in the graph, growth in women’s earnings has slowed in the past 2 decades. In the past 2 decades, the wage gap hasn’t really changed. As of 2022, a woman usually earns 82 cents for every dollar that a man earns(since 2002, this number has only increased by 2 cents), even despite the fact that women today have a higher likelihood of graduating college. (Kochhar, 2023)
				<br>
				<br>
				From 1982 to 2002, there was a significant amount of progress made in narrowing the wage gap. Women’s earnings increased from 65 cents for every dollar men made to 80 cents, which is a 15 cent increase. (Kochhar, 2023)

				1. The following section will explore the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for all women and all men.
				Let’s look at the men as an example: 
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 1: Identify the median salary of all men: 1,202
				Step 2: Find the absolute value(the positive) differences between the median salary for each race and the median salary of all women identified in Step 1. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Asian: |(Asian Median Salary )- (Median Salary for Men)| = |(1,635)-(1,202)| = 433
				<br>
				<br>
				Hispanic: |(Hispanic Median Salary)-(Median Salary for Men)| = |(915)-(1,202)| = 287
				<br>
				<br>
				Black: |( Black Median Salary) - (Median Salary for Men )| =|(970)-(1,202)|= 232
				<br>
				<br>
				White: | (White Median Salary)-(Median Salary for All Women)| = |(1,352)-(1,202)| = 150
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 3: Sort these 4 differences from least to most: 150, 232,  287, 433
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 4: Find the median of these differences, this will be your MAD:
				<br>
				<br>
				MAD =  (232+287)/2 = 259.5 
			</p>
			<h18>
			Now, use this process to find the MAD for all women:

			Identify the median salary of all women, and answer below: 
			<br>
			<br>
			Find the absolute value(the positive) differences between the median salary for each race and the median salary of all women identified in Step 1
			<br>
			<br>
			Asian: |(Asian Median Salary )- (Median Salary for Women)| = 
			<br>

			Hispanic: |(Hispanic Median Salary)-(Median Salary for Women)| =

			<br>
			White: | (White Median Salary)-(Median Salary for All Women)|  =

			<h2>Take Action!</h2>
			<p>
				After reflecting on this research, Jin and Ana decide to take action.
				<br><br>
				Jin: “I think this is such an important issue that affects everyone, including us!” 
				<br><br>
				Ana: “We need to spread more awareness so we can decrease the wage gap and achieve equity and equality.”
				<br><br>
				Jin: “You’re right, Ana! I think we can let more people know about this issue by creating a public social media account!”
				<br><br>
				Ana: “ I think we should bring up this problem with our Human Resources (HR) team!”
			</p>

				As time went on, Jin and Ana received more popularity, and their situation gained more awareness. More people mentioned that they experienced this problem in their workplace and expressed that they wanted to take action on this issue as well. Through this, more people tried to make change in this issue, and this effort started collective bargaining among Jin and Ana’s workplace on this issue, as well as in other workplaces as well. 
			</p>
			<p>
			After two years of advocating and raising awareness of the wage gap issue, Jin and Ana eventually received equal salary.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
